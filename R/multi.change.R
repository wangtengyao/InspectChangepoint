#' Generating a high-dimensional time series with multiple changepoints
#' @description The data matrix is generated via X = mu + W, where mu is the mean structure matrix that captures the changepoint locations and sparsity structure, and W is a random noise matrix having independent N(0,sigma^2) entries.
#' @param n Time length of the observation
#' @param p Dimension of the multivariate time series
#' @param ks A vector describing the number of coordinates that undergo a change in each changepoint. If only a scalar is supplied, each changepoint will have the same number of coordinates that undergo a change.
#' @param zs  A vector describing the locations of the changepoints.
#' @param varthetas A vector describing the root mean squared change magnitude in coordinates that undergo a change for each changepoint. If only a scalar is supplied, each changepoint will have the same signal strength value.
#' @param sigma noise level
#' @param overlap A number between 0 and 1. The proportion of overlap in the signal coordinates for successive changepoints.
#' @param shape How the signal strength is distributed across signal coordinates. When shape = 0, all signal coordinates are changed by the same amount; when shape = 1, their signal strength are proportional to 1, sqrt(2), ..., sqrt(k); when shape = 2, they are proportional to 1, 2, ..., k; when shape = 3, they are proportional to 1, 1/sqrt(2), ..., 1/sqrt(k).
#' @return An S3 object of the class 'hdchangeseq' is returned.
