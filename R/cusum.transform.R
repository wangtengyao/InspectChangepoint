#' CUSUM transformation
#' @description Performing CUSUM transformation to the input matrix of multivariate time series. If the input is a vector, it is treated as a matrix of one row.
#' @details For any integers p and n, the CUSUM transformation \eqn{T_{p,n}: R^{p\times n}\to R^{p\times (n-1)}} is defined by
#' \deqn{
#'    [T_{p,n}(M)]_{j,t} := \sqrt{t(n-t)/n}\biggl(\frac{1}{n-t}\sum_{r=t+1}^n M_{j,r} - #' \frac{1}{t}\sum_{r=1}^t M_{j,r}\biggr).
#' }
#'
#' @param x input matrix
#' @return The transformed matrix is returned. Note that the returned matrix has the same number of rows but one fewer columns compared with the input matrix.
#' @examples
#' x <- matrix(rnorm(20),4,5)
#' cusum.transform(x)
#' @export
