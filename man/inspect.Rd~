\title{
Multiple changepoint estimation via sparse projection
}
\description{
The function \code{inspect} estimate the location of multiple changepoints in the mean structure of a multivariate time series. Multiple changepoints are estimated using a (wild) binary segmentation scheme, whereas each segmentation step uses the \code{locate.change} function. 
}
\usage{
inspect(x, lambda, threshold, schatten = c(1, 2), M)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
The input data matrix of high-dimensional time series. 
}
  \item{lambda}{
Regularisation parameter used in \code{locate.change}, if no value is supplied, the dafault value is chosen to be log(log(n)*p/2) for p and n number of rows and columns of the data matrix x respectively.
}
  \item{threshold}{
Threshold level for testing whether an identified changepoint is a true changepoint. If no value is supplied, the threshold level is computed via Monte Carlo simulation of 100 repetitions. 
}
  \item{schatten}{
The Schatten norm constraint to use in the \code{locate.change} function. Default is schatten = 2, i.e. a Frobenius norm constraint.
}
  \item{M}{
The Monte Carlo parameter used for wild binary segmentation. Default is M = 0, which means a classical binary segmentation scheme is used. 
}
}
\details{
The input time series is first standardised using \code{rescale.variance} function. Recursive calls of \code{locate.change} function then segments the multivariate time series using (wild) binary segmentation. Changepoint at time z is defined here to mean that the time series has constant mean structure for time up to z and constant mean structure for time from z+1 onwards.

More details about model assumption and theoretical guarantees can be found in Wang and Samworth (2016). Note that Monte Carlo computation of the threshold value can be slow, especially for large p. If \code{inspect} is to be used multiple times with the same (or similar) data matrix size, it is better to precompute the threshold level via Monte Carlo simulation by calling the \code{compute.threshold} function.

\value{
The return value is an S3 object of class 'inspect'
  \item{x }{The input data matrix}
  \item{changepoints }{A matrix with three columns. The first column contains locations of changepoints sorted in increasing order; the second column contains the maximum CUSUM statistics of the projected univariate time series associated with each estimated changepoint; the third column contains the depth of binary segmentation for the detected changepoint}
